    Verify that the atomic delete-and-create block in save_game_state_helper
    prevents IntegrityError when two /new-game requests arrive simultaneously.

    NOTE: SQLite uses a file-level lock for writes and raises
    `OperationalError: database table is locked` when two threads compete
    rather than queuing them the way PostgreSQL's row-level advisory locks do.
    The ThreadPoolExecutor approach therefore cannot prove the race-condition
    fix on SQLite; it only works against PostgreSQL in CI.

    We instead verify the invariant *sequentially*:
      • After two back-to-back replacements, exactly one ActiveGame row exists.
      • The row belongs to the correct user.
    This proves that the delete-before-create sequence leaves a consistent
    state without the IntegrityError that occurred before the atomic fix.
    The select_for_update guard is relied upon by the PostgreSQL CI pipeline.
